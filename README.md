# Minecraft Resource Mapper
This is a quick and dirty tool to map all Minecraft resources from their hashed names back to the original file structure.

## Example Usage
```bash
cd '~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/assets/'
mc-rm indexes/1.11.json objects/
```

A folder named `output` containing the original file structure will be created in the current directory.
